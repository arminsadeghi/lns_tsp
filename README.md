# LNS solver in C with python bindings

This is a collection of heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The core solver is written in C for performance, and Python bindings are provided for ease of use.

# Usage
To use the solver, you can import the `tsp_solver.solver.Solver` module in Python. The config for the solver is a `json` file that specifies the parameters for the solver. `tsp_solver/main.py` is an example of how to use the solver.
